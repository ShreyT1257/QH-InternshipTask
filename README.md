# QH-InternshipTask3
As listed in the task provided, a random 10 images are to be considered with any width and height and are to be resized without distorting their dimensions.
It was stated that we could use HTML/CSS and should start the task using Bootstrap, hence the layout of the complete web page is built as specified.
My Analysis and Working: 
I picked up 10 images from Google and displayed them on one web page that resembles the first part, later using another web page created equal partitions
and displayed those images in two divisions that looked like separate sections !

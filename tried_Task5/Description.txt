Tahnkful for the Opportunity !

Task 5:
Build website for brand or celebrity using HTML, CSS, JavaScript or JQuery
(Couldn't add to Heroku due to some errors for Heroku CLI)


My Approach:
Divided the Web Page into 7 divisions / sections
Header (Navigation Bar) to navigate around the several links (not in use currently)
Template => Tagline or Motive, kind of small brief statements (Video for Advertisements or Add purposes)
Products => Some Important stuff can be highlighted 
Company Advantages => just listing out good things or growth aspects
Our Cases => Fields of Interest or Working on can be displayed with a small descriptive note
Send Mail => for the visitors to contact or get in touch
Footer => Copyright status or desired materials to be focused on !

Thankful for the Opportunity !
This is a folder separately created to store all the images used in the task.

TASK 3:
Consider 10 images of varying sizes (height != width).
Resize them in such a way that images are not stretched. (Cropping Corners acceptable)
Put a small icon at centre of images
use bootstrap to begin,can use HTML, CSS, JavaScript or JQuery
Add a link to Heroku (sorry couldn't do that... Heroku CLI has some issues with installation)

My Approach:
Tried to show the changes on two separate html pages: HOME, RESIZED
Using bootsrap have created a Navigation Bar, Footer for the page to look kind of good !
HOME => randomly placed images inside the body section (<div>)
RESIZED => Created two divisions where stored five images each of equal proprtions to their original sizes
Rest header links are just not redirected as not much in use....
